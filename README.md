# HWR OOP Lecture Project - Bowling

This repository contains a student project created for an ongoing lecture on object-oriented programming with Java at 
HWR Berlin (summer term 2023).

> :warning: This code is for educational purposes only. Do not rely on it!

## Abstract

[TODO]: <> (Write a short description of your project.)
This application provides the logic of a bowling game. 
The player has to give the number of fallen pins to the program. 
The program then calculates the points and the bonus points for every round.
Multiple Players are supported.

[TODO]: <> (State most important features.)
[not implemented]: <> (Score Table Calculation)
[not implemented]: <> (User Management)

### Problems
[TODO]: <> (State the most interesting problems you encountered during the project.)
Test driven development is hard to grasp at first, but easier the more time you spend on it.

## Feature List
- play a bowling game
- multiplayer and singleplayer are supported
- robust error handling and input sanitisation
- text-mode output

[TODO]: <> (Add a new row to the table for every completed feature.)
