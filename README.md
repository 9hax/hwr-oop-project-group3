# HWR OOP Lecture Project - Bowling

This repository contains a student project created for an ongoing lecture on object-oriented programming with Java at 
HWR Berlin (summer term 2023).

## Abstract

[TODO]: <> (Write a short description of your project.)
This application provides the logic of a bowling game. 
The player has to give the number of fallen pins to the program. 
The program then calculates the points and the bonus points for every round.
Multiple Players are supported.

[TODO]: <> (State most important features.)
[not implemented]: <> (Score Table Calculation)
[not implemented]: <> (User Management)
[not implemented]: <> (Automatic Winner detection)

### Problems
[TODO]: <> (State the most interesting problems you encountered during the project.)
Test driven development is hard to grasp at first, but easier the more time you spend on it.

## Feature List

[TODO]: <> (Add a new row to the table for every completed feature.)

| Number | Feature   | Tests |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| 1      | Throws    | 4     |
| 2      | Rounds    | 21    |
| 3      | Player    | 7     |
| 4      | Game      | 3     |
| 5      | IOAdapter | 6     |
| 6      | UI        | 1     |

## Additional Dependencies

[TODO]: <> (Add a new row to the table for every required dependency.)

| Number | Dependency Name | Dependency Description   | Why is it necessary?                           |
|--------|-----------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | JVM             | The programming language | Because you need to programm, but I'm not sure |
