## Abstract

[TODO]: <> (Write a short description of your project.)
This application provides the logic of a bowling game. The player has to give the fallen pins to the program. Then it calculates the points and the bonus points of every round.

[TODO]: <> (State most important features.)
[not implemented]: <> (Score Table Calculation)
[not implemented]: <> (User Management)
[not implemented]: <> (Automatic Winner detection)

### Problems
[TODO]: <> (State the most interesting problems you encountered during the project.)
Test driven development is hard to grasp at first, but easier the more time you spend on it.

## Feature List

[TODO]: <> (Add a new row to the table for every completed feature.)

| Number | Feature | Tests |
|--------|---------|-------|
| 1      | Throws  | 4     |
| 2      | Rounds  | 19    |
| 3      | Player  | 5     |
| 4      | Game    | 1     |

## Additional Dependencies

[TODO]: <> (Add a new row to the table for every required dependency.)

| Number | Dependency Name | Dependency Description | Why is it necessary? |
|--------|-----------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| 1      | /               | /                      | /                    |
